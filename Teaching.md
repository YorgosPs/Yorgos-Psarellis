### Teaching Experience

#### Teaching Academy Certification

I received a [certification](https://cer.jhu.edu/teaching-academy) from the Center of Educational Resources, JHU for attending intensive classes and seminars on Pedagogy in Higher Ed. My curriculum focused around [Evidence-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_education), [Bloom's taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)  and Diversity in the classroom.  

Through this program, I was hired to train and provide resources to new Teaching Assistants in STEM.
