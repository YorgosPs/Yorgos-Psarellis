### Teaching Experience

#### Teaching Academy Certification

I received a [certification](https://cer.jhu.edu/teaching-academy) from the Center of Educational Resources, JHU for attending intensive classes and seminars on Pedagogy in Higher Ed. My curriculum focused around [Evidence-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_education), [Bloom's taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)  and Diversity in the classroom.  

Through this program, I was hired to train and provide resources to new Teaching Assistants in STEM.

#### Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Certification

I received a [certification](https://cer.jhu.edu/files_ta/JEDI_Revised_2.pdf) for attending a training seminar series on JEDI, where I learned how I can create a more safe and inclusive classroom experience for my students.

#### Teaching Assistant, Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos

I served as a Teaching Assistant to ~20 graduate / senior undergraduate students for the class Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos. I assisted students with educational software throughout the class, especially with their final projects. I also delivered ~8 hours of lectures, including on Fractals which I designed under the supervision of the instructor.

#### Teaching Assistant: Advanced Transport Phenomena

I served as a teaching Assistant for ~20 PhD students for the core class of Advanced Transport Phenomena. This included proctoring, grading and delivering a 2h revision session. 

#### Technology Fellow: Turning a Nonlinear Dynamics Class into a Virtual Laboratory

I got funded with $5,000 from the Center of Educational Resources to develop software and educational material for the class Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos.  These software included [SCIGMA](https://github.com/scigma/scigma) and [AUTO](https://github.com/auto-07p/auto-07p), two state-of-the-art educational (and research) software.
