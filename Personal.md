When I'm **not** researching or teaching, you will find me:

Hanging out or traveling with friends  

Reading (oscillating between sci-fi and philosophy)  

Cooking (especially Greek cousine)  

Bartending (AI inspired cocktails coming up!)  

Learning a new language (currently: Spanish!)  

Bouldering
