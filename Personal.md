When I'm **not** researching or teaching, you will find me:

Hanging out or traveling with friends  

Reading (oscillating between sci-fi and philosophy)  

Cooking (especially Mediterranean cousine)  

Bartending (AI inspired cocktails coming up!)  

Learning a new language   
    I speak: Greek(native), English, German, Spanish (currently learning!) and Arabic (beginner)

Bouldering
