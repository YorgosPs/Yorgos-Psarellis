* #### Learning how Bacteria move  with Neural Networks  
Chemotaxis is the ability of bacteria to direct multicellular motion along chemical gradients [1]. This phenomenon is central to environmental, medical and agricultural processes. For this project, I trained Neural Networks that *learn* Chemotactic PDEs, and when integrated, can reproduce and predict bacterial density profiles. This has been done in the following cases:
  * Black-box PDE models
  * Gray-box PDE models
  * Partial information - second order models
  * Data from Monte-Carlo simulations (agent-based models)
  * Sparse, experimental data

**Fig.1** : The Data-driven PDE is able to reproduce the bacteria density profiles beyond the training set and predict new trajectories.

**Fig.2** : Data-driven PDEs can be trained on experimental data. Here the Neural Network 'learns' and reproduces what is seen in the microscoped.
