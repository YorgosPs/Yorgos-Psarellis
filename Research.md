### PhD Projects

* Neural Networks learning how Bacteria move  
Chemotaxis is the ability of bacteria to direct multicellular motion along chemical gradients. This phenomenon is central to environmental, medical and agricultural processes. For this project, I trained Neural Networks that *learns* Chemotactic PDEs, and when integrated, can reproduce and predict bacterial density profiles. This has been done in the following cases:
  * Black-box PDE models
  * Gray-box PDE models
  * Partial information - second order models
  * Data from Monte-Carlo simulations (agent-based models)
  * Sparse, experimental data
